Turn you WordPress blog into a Blogmesh node. Follow friends (and RSS feeds), and turn your homepage into a timeline of all their updates.

== Description ==
Blogmesh aims te make blogging more social, and in doing so create an alternative for existing social networks. The main idea is to connect existing blogs in a way that resembles other social networks, like Twitter. Simply follow your friends and see a timeline of their updates.

Because blogs are usually self-hosted, this means Blogmesh has the potential to become a decentralized network that belongs to its users, and where every user owns their own content.

Blogmesh uses existing, well-established standards like RSS. This means that many existing sites are already Blogmesh-ready.
